# babbel-calculator

This react app was written over three days as the coding challenge portion of an interview for an internship with Babbel, Inc. 

I'd previously used Vue, but this project was my first time making heavy use of react/redux. 

In the end, I got the internship, and worked in frontend for Babbel USA from May to August 2020. :) 

There are some idiosyncrasies in this project--mainly, for a complicated set of reasons, React components are written in the templating language Pug, not JSX. (If I were to do it again, things would be the other way around.)
